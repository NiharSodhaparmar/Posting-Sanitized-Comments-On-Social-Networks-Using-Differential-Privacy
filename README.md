## Overview

This repository accompanies the research paper "_Posting Sanitized Comments On Social Networks Using Differential Privacy_," which addresses privacy concerns on social media by developing a method to obscure sensitive user data within comments and tweets. The approach uses Differential Privacy (DP) to replace sensitive words, misleading inference models while preserving the overall meaning. We evaluate our method on real social media datasets, achieving reduced classifier accuracy on sensitive attributes such as gender and political affiliation while maintaining high semantic similarity between the original and differentially private text.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **`Comments`**: Contains experimental files related to comments.
- **`Tweets`**: Contains experimental files related to tweets.

Each of these folders includes the following subfolders:

1. **`Dataset`**  
   Contains the data used for experiments, including comments or tweets categorized by gender or political affiliation.

2. **`Models`**  
   Subfolders for each machine learning model utilized in this study:

   - **`BERT`**: Fine-tuned BERT models used for attribute inference on comments and tweets.
   - **`CNN`** and **`RNN`**: Additional models trained for inference tasks on both datasets.
   - Each folder includes scripts to extract strong features ("strong words") relevant to each model for privacy transformation.

3. **`Check Similarity`**  
   Python scripts to measure the similarity between original and differentially private versions of comments and tweets, ensuring the transformation retains semantic integrity.

4. **`Replaced Words`**  
   Scripts that replace sensitive words in comments and tweets with non-sensitive alternatives from a word embedding database (GloVe Wiki Giga Word), generating differential privacy-compliant text.

## Methodology

1. **Extracting Strong Features**  
   Using LIME, we identify sensitive words within comments or tweets. These "strong words" are integral to classifier inference and are targeted for substitution.

2. **Generating Differentially Private Text**  
   Sensitive words are substituted with semantically similar alternatives using the GloVe embedding database. Our approach utilizes Utility-Optimized Metric Local Differential Privacy (UMLDP) to ensure that replacements maintain semantic relevance while providing privacy.

3. **Similarity Checking**  
   We employ sentence embedding models (BERT, Sentence BERT, DistilBERT) to quantify similarity between original and differentially private texts, with cosine similarity scores to measure semantic preservation.

## Experiment Results

Four scenarios were tested for sensitive word replacement (top 2 or 3 words with top 10 or 15 similar words), showing a significant reduction in classifier accuracy across all models while retaining high similarity scores. For instance, replacing the top 3 sensitive words in comments with top 15 similar words reduced BERT's accuracy from 79.07% to 30.34%, CNN's accuracy from 75.90% to 29.57% and RNN's accuracy from 74.27% to 32.88%.
